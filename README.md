# Salary Prediction Web App

## Introduction
This project is a Streamlit-based web app that predicts salaries based on user inputs such as country, education level, and years of experience. Using real-world data, we build a machine learning model to estimate salaries and visualize average salaries across various countries. Itâ€™s a great way to showcase data analysis, model building, and web development skills in one interactive app.
